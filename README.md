# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively.

These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. This is because customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.

CLean visualizations to help in gaining clearer insights from our data.

Not only that a supervised model can also be build by feeding in the data that we just clustered. But there will be no 100% surity of the ground truth. But with enough domain experience we can label these clusters and perform classification on the new customer.
